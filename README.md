#### This repository contains tools to perform animal behavioral analysis from drone videos.

The modular pipeline processes drone video through object detection, individual tracking, and machine learning-based behavioral classification to generate ecological metrics including time budgets, behavioral transitions, land use and habitat, social interactions, and demographic data. Framework design enables integration of novel ML models and adaptation across species and study systems.

Understanding community-level ecological patterns requires scalable methods to process multi-dimensional behavioral data. Traditional field observations are limited in scope, making it difficult to assess behavioral responses across landscapes. To address this, we present Kenyan Animal Behavior Recognition, kabr-tools. This open-source computational ecology framework integrates drone-based video with machine learning to automatically extract behavioral, social, and spatial metrics from wildlife footage.

Our pipeline processes multi-species drone data using object detection, tracking, and behavioral classification to generate five key metrics: time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat associations, and group composition dynamics. Validated on three African species, our system achieved 65 - 70% behavioral classification accuracy, with >95%.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The KABR tools pipeline consists of:

1. **Drone-based video collection**
2. **Annotation and tracking using CVAT**
3. **Mini-scene extraction**
4. **Behavior classification**
5. **Ecological analysis**

Each script can be run via command-line (`<tool-name> -h`) or imported as a module.

## Methodology Comparison and Case Studies

####  See [docs/methodology_comparison.md](docs/methodology_comparison.md) for a detailed comparison of different methods for animal behavior analysis, including:
- Focal sampling
- Scan sampling
- Drone-based video analysis

#### See [docs/case_studies.md](docs/case_studies.md) for case studies demonstrating the application of kabr-tools in various ecological contexts, including:
- Grevy's zebra time budgets
- Mixed-species social interactions

#### Example time budget analysis output comparing behavior granularity collected from drone videos versus traditional field observations.

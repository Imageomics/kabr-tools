The `time_budgets.csv` file in this `data/` directory contains the time budget data used in the time budget case study. This file was compiled from the [KABR raw videos collection](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/KABR-raw-videos/) in HuggingFace, using the videos from [`18_01_2023_session_7/`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/KABR-raw-videos/tree/main/18_01_2023_session_7). This session captured two male Grevy's zebras moving across an open habitat at the [Mpala Research Centre](https://mpala.org/) in Kenya. See [KABR worked examples](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/kabr-worked-examples) in HuggingFace for step-by-step data from detections, to mini-scenes, to behaviors.

The scripts provided in the /helper_scripts/annotate_mini_scenes directory allow users to submit jobs to a shared computer.
The jobs are submitted to automatically annotate mini scene videos with behavior labels using the provided model.

To use the scripts:
1. Update jobs and account number in launch_jobs.py
2. Run launch_jobs.py. This will call run.sh, which will in turn call annotate.py.
3. This will generate a csv file for each video with the following columns [video, track, frame, label]. See /data/mini_scene_behavior_annotations in HuggingFace for example output.
